/**
 * tRPC Server Configuration
 * 
 * This file configures the tRPC server with context, middleware, and error handling.
 * It provides type-safe API endpoints with authentication and database access.
 * 
 * Key components:
 * 1. Context creation with database and session access
 * 2. Middleware for authentication and authorization
 * 3. Error formatting and validation
 * 4. Procedure types (public, protected, admin)
 * 
 * You typically don't need to edit this file unless you want to:
 * - Modify request context (see Part 1)
 * - Create new middleware or procedure types (see Part 3)
